# Marketing_Research_Report--Factors_Affecting_Consumer_Behaviour_Towards_Electronic-Products
The research project titled "Factors Influencing Sustainable Consumer Behaviour Towards Electronic Products" was a collaborative effort undertaken by a group of seven members. Through extensive secondary research, the team aimed to identify the key drivers that influence consumers' adoption of sustainable practices when purchasing electronic devices. The project employed a mixed-methodologies approach, combining quantitative and qualitative techniques, and yielded several significant findings:

1. Identification of three distinct factors shaping consumer perceptions: "Feature of Green Product," "Quality of Green Product," and "Elegancy."
2. Emphasis on the importance of energy efficiency, product recycling programs, latest technology features, environmental responsibility, next buying decisions, and brand diversity in the "Feature of Green Product" factor.
3. Association of eco-friendliness and higher prices with the "Quality of Green Product" factor, highlighting the link between quality and sustainability in consumer perceptions.
4. Significance of design and aesthetics in the "Elegancy" factor, underscoring the role of product appearance in influencing sustainable choices.
5. Robust statistical analysis, including factor analysis and regression analysis, to validate the findings and provide practical implications for businesses, policymakers, and stakeholders.
6. Comprehensive literature review and data analysis techniques, such as descriptive analysis, factor analysis, and regression analysis, to support the research objectives.

The repository contains the complete research project report, data files, analysis scripts, and supporting documentation, serving as a valuable resource for promoting sustainable consumer behavior in the electronic products domain.
